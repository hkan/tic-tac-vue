# Tic-Tac-Vue

Tic-Tac-Vue is an online tic-tac-toe game built with Vue.js framework. A live version of the game *will* be available [tictacvue.herokuapp.com](https://tictacvue.herokuapp.com/).

## Temporary warning

I screwed up by pushing commits while in the middle of a *Vue to Vue 2* transition, and didn't want to try to take it back as there is already a `v1.0` branch with last stable codes. This notice will be cleared once the game is up and running again. Until then, you can check out and try the `v1.0` branch if you'd like.
